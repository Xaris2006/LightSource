# Chess Lab

Chess Lab is a simple chess GUI that chess players can use to save, open and analyse chess games with also the help of a chess game (default Stockfish). With this program you can create your own Chess Opening Book (COB) files that you can use to improve your perfomance in openings.

## Requirements
- [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.com) (not strictly required, however included setup scripts only support this)

## Getting Started
Once you've cloned, run `scripts/Setup-ChessLab.bat` to generate Visual Studio 2022 solution/project files. Once you've opened the solution, you can run the ChessLab project to run the chess board app. To run the ChessLab-Lobby project you have to build the ChessLab-Board project in Dist configuration and copy its .exe file from 'bin\Dist-windows-x86_64\ChessLab-Board' directory to 'ChessLab-Lobby\ChessLabApp' directory.

There might a problem when building the project. Please check that all needed projects use the same setting on: c/c++ -> Code Generation -> Runtime Library.
